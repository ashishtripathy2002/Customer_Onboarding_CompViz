## Challenges
- Handling time out issues for FAST API calls.
- Rotated images and their OCR output
- Starting `ray` code structure
- Navigating through project directories via pathlib.

## Learnings
- Learnt how to use multiple image processing libraries `cv2, mdeiapipe, face_recognition` for validations
- Gained experience with `loguru` for logging.
- Experiencing `ray` 
- Understanding async calls to handle timeout issues.
- Using `mkdocs-material` made documentation easier.
- Modularizing code helped with maintainability.

## Future Scope
- Using llms as an alternative for Rule based analysis
- Using pytesseract as an alternative for easyOCR
- Trying deepface / face_recognition library for facial images similarity ( although they take more time )
